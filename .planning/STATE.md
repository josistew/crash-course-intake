## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: CSV paste-in over API integration for v1 — fastest to ship, no auth setup from Rez
- [Init]: Google Sheets for reporting/payroll — Rez already lives in Google Workspace
- [Init]: Next.js + Vercel for checklist — proven LeaseJenny pattern, free hosting
- [Init]: Google Sheets as checklist data store — keeps everything in Google ecosystem

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Must validate actual CSV column names from DoorDash, UberEats, Grubhub, and Square with Rez's real exports before writing any formulas — do NOT assume column names
- [Phase 1]: Confirm BEK Entree CSV has food/non-food category column (affects food purchases % calculation)
- [Phase 2]: Download Gusto Smart Import sample template before designing Payroll-Output tab structure
- [Phase 2]: Confirm whether any employees work across multiple locations (determines overtime architecture urgency)
- [Phase 3]: Confirm expected concurrent tablet usage volume before committing to direct Sheets writes vs. Vercel KV write buffer
